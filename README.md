# MoMent

MoMent is a lightweight open-source platform for creating and publishing minimal online photography exhibitions. It was originally developed for a cultural heritage photography club, but can be adapted for student groups, artists, archives, museums, and community exhibitions.

## What It Solves

Small exhibition teams often need a quiet online gallery that can be edited locally and published as a static site without adopting a full CMS. MoMent keeps the public exhibition simple, stores photo metadata in SQLite, and exports a Cloudflare Pages-ready `dist/` folder.

## Features

- Minimal public photography exhibition with intro overlay, a single-row responsive navigation, hover/tap metadata, and keyboard- and swipe-enabled lightbox viewing.
- Local-only administrator interface for one admin account.
- Photo upload, expanded metadata editing, deletion, and generated display/lightbox image variants.
- Gallery filtering by year, region, photographer, and place, with filters and the open photo reflected in the shareable URL.
- Integrated public guestbook, with photo-specific entries also shown in each lightbox.
- Photo lightbox with compact metadata and rectangular `정보`/`방명록` tabs; keyboard and swipe gestures remain available without a persistent previous/next control bar.
- SQLite storage for the local admin app.
- Static export for Cloudflare Pages or another static host.
- Public visit counter, latest-update marker, and guestbook APIs through Cloudflare Pages Functions and a D1 binding.

## Tech Stack

- Python 3.13 and 3.14
- SQLite
- Plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Pillow for image validation and display/lightbox variants
- Cloudflare Pages Functions for public counters and guestbook APIs

## Requirements

- Python 3.13 or 3.14
- `pip`
- A shell that can run the `py` launcher on Windows, or `python` on other platforms

Install dependencies:

```powershell
py -3.13 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

On non-Windows systems, use the equivalent Python command:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Setup

Create the local administrator account:

```powershell
py -3.13 manage.py init-admin --username admin
```

The command prompts for a password when `--password` is omitted. Use at least 8 characters. For local development only, you can also copy `.env.example` to `.env` and use the bootstrap admin variables described below.

## Run Locally

```powershell
py -3.13 run.py
```

Open the printed local URL, then open the configured admin path. The default admin path is `/admin`.

The admin app binds to loopback by default. MoMent refuses non-loopback binds unless `MOMENT_ALLOW_NETWORK_ADMIN=true` is explicitly set. Use that exception only on a trusted private network, and never expose the Python admin server directly to the public internet.

## Managing Photos

1. Start the local server.
2. Open the admin path.
3. Log in with the account created by `init-admin`.
4. Add, edit, or delete photographs and metadata.
5. Run a static export before publishing public changes.

The collection manager includes local search, collapsed photo editors, unsaved-change warnings, advanced location fields, and a publish checklist. These helpers do not deploy automatically; the export and deployment steps remain explicit.

Uploaded originals are stored in `uploads/`. Metadata is stored in `data/moment.db`. Both are local runtime data and are ignored by git except for `uploads/.gitkeep`.

Photo metadata includes the original date/location/photographer fields plus year, region, display place name, `placeId`, optional latitude/longitude, and an optional description. If `placeId` is left blank, MoMent generates a stable internal place id from the display place name.

Operational rules for guestbook deletion, photo descriptions, and representative map coordinates are documented in `docs/operating-policy.md`.

## Static Export

Export the public exhibition:

```powershell
py -3.13 manage.py export-static
```

By default this writes to `dist/`. The export contains:

- `index.html`
- `404.html` for real not-found responses instead of SPA soft 404s
- `static/css/site.css`
- `static/js/exhibition.js`
- `static/js/modules/`
- `static/og/`
- `static/qr/`
- `static/icons/`
- `uploads/` display and lightbox images used by the public site
- `data/photos.json`
- `_headers` for Cloudflare Pages cache and security headers
- `.moment-static-export` marker used by the exporter safety check

The admin page is not exported. Admin editing remains local in the Python app.

## Cloudflare Pages Deployment

1. Edit photos locally in the admin page.
2. Run `py -3.13 manage.py export-static`.
3. Commit or upload the generated `dist/` folder to the repository connected to Cloudflare Pages.
4. Configure Cloudflare Pages:
   - Framework preset: `None`
   - Build command: leave empty when `dist/` is already committed
   - Build output directory: `dist`
5. Bind a D1 database named `VISITS_DB` if you want public visits, latest update, and guestbook APIs to work.
6. Back up the D1 database, then apply `migrations/0001_initial_schema.sql` before deploying the matching Functions. See `migrations/README.md`.
7. Generate a high-entropy deletion token with `py -3.13 manage.py generate-operator-token --purpose trace-delete`, save the raw token in a password manager, and set its printed verifier as the Cloudflare secret `TRACE_DELETE_TOKEN_HASH`.
8. Generate a separate status token with `py -3.13 manage.py generate-operator-token --purpose status-update` and set its printed verifier as `STATUS_UPDATE_TOKEN_HASH`. There is no committed fallback. Send the raw token only in the request header, for example `Authorization: Bearer <token>`.

After each exhibition change, export again and redeploy the updated `dist/`.

## Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` for local overrides. Do not commit `.env`.

| `MOMENT_SESSION_COOKIE` | `moment_session` | Admin session cookie name. |
| `MOMENT_SESSION_MAX_AGE` | `43200` | Admin session lifetime in seconds. |
| `MOMENT_SECURE_COOKIES` | `auto` | Use `true` behind HTTPS, `false` for local HTTP, or `auto` to infer from `MOMENT_ADMIN_URL`. |
| `MOMENT_PUBLIC_URL` | empty | Optional canonical public URL used in generated metadata. |
| `MOMENT_ADMIN_URL` | empty | Optional admin server URL used only for secure cookie auto-detection. |
| `MOMENT_TRACE_DELETE_TOKEN_HASH` | empty | Local SHA-256 verifier for a generated high-entropy hidden trace deletion token. |
| `MOMENT_STATUS_UPDATE_TOKEN_HASH` | empty | Optional SHA-256 hash accepted by the Cloudflare status-update Function as an alias for `STATUS_UPDATE_TOKEN_HASH`. |
| `STATUS_UPDATE_TOKEN` | empty | Local-only raw token used by operator scripts to call `POST /api/status-update`. Do not commit or share it. |
| `MOMENT_ADMIN_USERNAME` | empty | Optional first-run bootstrap admin username. |
| `MOMENT_ADMIN_PASSWORD` | empty | Optional first-run bootstrap admin password. Do not use in shared files. |

## Security And Deployment Notes

- The Python admin server is a local management app, not a public production server. Non-loopback binds require the explicit `MOMENT_ALLOW_NETWORK_ADMIN=true` exception.
- Keep `.env`, `data/moment.db`, `data/secret.key`, logs, and original uploads out of commits.
- The admin path can reduce casual discovery, but real protection comes from authentication, signed sessions, and not exposing the admin server publicly.
- Session cookies are `HttpOnly` and `SameSite=Strict`; set `MOMENT_ADMIN_URL=https://...` or `MOMENT_SECURE_COOKIES=true` when the admin server is served through HTTPS.
- Admin login failures are rate-limited for 15 minutes by both IP+username pairs (5 failures) and the source IP overall (20 failures).
- Public photo JSON omits local original filenames and internal created/updated timestamps; those fields are only returned to the local admin API.
- Admin mutation requests require a same-origin `Origin` or `Referer` header in addition to the signed session.
- The static export includes Cloudflare `_headers`, HSTS, a restrictive CSP, a real `404.html`, long-lived asset caching for stable assets, and revalidation for JavaScript modules.
- Cloudflare Functions require the committed D1 migration to be applied before deployment; they no longer run schema or moderation writes during public GET requests.
- The guestbook is public. It has basic validation and atomic D1-backed rate limiting, not full moderation tooling. Hidden deletion uses a generated high-entropy token and a separate rate-limit bucket.
- The visit counter deduplicates a long-lived anonymous browser token and rate-limits writes. It is still an approximate exhibition visit count, not an identity-verified unique-person metric.
